# AI Agent with LangGraph, LangSmith, Claude, and Tavily

This repository demonstrates how to create an AI Agent using [LangGraph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/) with [LangSmith](https://www.langchain.com/langsmith), [Claude](https://www.anthropic.com/claude) and [Tavily](https://tavily.com/) to build AI-powered applications using multimodal capabilities. It's designed as a starting point for developers looking to explore and experiment with LangGraph AI Agents.

## üöÄ Features
- **Beginner-friendly**: Simple setup to get started quickly.
- **LLM Integration:** Powered by Claude for advanced reasoning and natural language capabilities.
- **Search Integration:** Employs Tavily as a tool, allowing the agent to query the web, retrieve information, and enhance its knowledge of current events or data outside the training corpus.
- **Extensible:** Easily adapt the agent to incorporate new tools, models, or additional data sources.
